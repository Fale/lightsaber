threebean's badges
==================

This is my own personal instance of `التحرير (Tahrir)
<https://github.com/fedora-infra/tahrir>`_, the web application that powers
`Fedora Badges <https://badges.fedoraproject.org/>`_.  I use it to award
fun/random `open badges <http://openbadges.org>`_ to my friends and colleagues.

I use an `ansible <http://ansibleworks.com>`_ playbook to deploy it to Fedora
19 on `digital ocean <https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=e33fef6dd7ac>`_.
You are more than welcome to `copy the playbook and/or role
<https://github.com/ralphbean/snackpack>`_ to set up your own.
